# MetaMenta project
The computation of confidence is modulated by mentalizing 

This repository contains analysis code and data for Van der Plas, Mason, Livingston, Craigie, Happe & Fleming (in prep) “Computations of confidence are modulated by mentalizing” [..]

Anonymised behavioural data files are included in the repository to enable replication of the analyses and a reproduction of the figures in the manuscript. 

If you simply download the folder to Dropbox the paths should work without changing the code
